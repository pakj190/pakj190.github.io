    <h3>MY portFOLIO : My Digital Interactive Art Gallery</h3>
    <p>Welcome to my hobby gallery where anyone can learn the hobbies I enjoy through this interactive experience.</p>
    <p>I specifically used these colors and fonts to give a warm and relaxed vibe that isn't too stimulating because I want the main focus to be on the art and the progress. The font choice is because I want to have an elegant modern vibe that is reader-friendly.</p>
    <p>taking inspiration from the https://dam.org homepage to create my homepage</p>
